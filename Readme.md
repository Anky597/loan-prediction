Loan Approval System with Explainable AI
Tools: Python, Scikit-learn, Flask, LIME, SHAP
Models: Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost

Developed a machine learning-based loan approval system utilizing a dataset of 13 features (loan amount, income, credit score, etc.). Implemented and benchmarked multiple models to predict loan approval, with a focus on accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score. Integrated LIME and SHAP explainability techniques to enhance model transparency for stakeholders. Deployed the system using Flask for real-time loan prediction.

Logistic Regression: Accuracy 90.52%, Precision 87.86%, Recall 86.48%, F1 Score 87.16%
Random Forest: Accuracy 97.78%, Precision 97.76%, Recall 96.23%, F1 Score 96.99%
XGBoost (Best Model): Accuracy 98.24%, Precision 98.10%, Recall 97.17%, F1 Score 97.63%
Result: Achieved an optimized loan approval model with 98.24% accuracy using XGBoost, providing clear explanations for decisions using SHAP and LIME visualizations.
